# Hello World API

## Purpose

A simple REST API with `/hello` endpoint deployed on Azure using Terraform modules.

## API

- **Endpoint:** `/hello`
- **Method:** GET
- **Response:** `Hello World`

## Assumptions

- The API must be public to stakeholders in the Brande office and Zalando partners.
  - Since we donâ€™t have specific IPs for partners, the API is public.
- No authentication is added for simplicity.
- Hosted on **Azure App Service** (simple, fast, cost-effective for small scale).
- Terraform state is local for now.
  - In production, would use a remote backend (e.g., Azure Storage Account).
- No CI/CD for main test, but would add GitHub Actions in the future.
- Logging can be viewed in xxxxxx.scm.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole
  - In production, would integrate with Application Insights.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Terraform >= 1.4.0
- Azure subscription

## Deploy

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd app
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set your unique suffix in `terraform/terraform.tfvars`:

   ```hcl
   unique_suffix = "your-unique-suffix"
   ```

3. Deploy infrastructure with Terraform:

   ```bash
   cd ../terraform
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

4. Deploy your app code to Azure (from project root):

   ```bash
   cd app
   zip -r ../app.zip .
   cd ..
   az login
   az webapp deployment source config-zip \
     --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
     --name <your-app-service-name> \
     --src app.zip
   ```
   Replace `<your-resource-group>` and `<your-app-service-name>` with your actual values (see Terraform output).

5. Visit the output URL to test your API.

## Troubleshooting

If your app fails to start or you encounter issues:

1. **Check the App Service logs:**
   - Go to the Kudu/Advanced Tools site for your app:
     - `https://<your-app-service-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole`
     - Example: [https://hello-world-api-keithkeithkeithkeith.scm.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole](https://hello-world-api-keithkeithkeithkeith.scm.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole)
   - In the Debug Console, navigate to the `LogFiles` directory to view logs and diagnose problems.

2. **Check the Log Stream in Azure Portal:**
   - Go to your App Service in the Azure Portal.
   - Select **Log stream** from the left menu to view real-time logs.

3. **Common Issues:**
   - App not listening on the correct port (should use the `PORT` environment variable).
   - Startup command or file/module name mismatch.
   - Missing dependencies in `requirements.txt`.

## Note

- Remember to destroy the infrastructure after testing to avoid unnecessary charges:

  ```bash
  cd ../terraform
  terraform destroy
  ```
